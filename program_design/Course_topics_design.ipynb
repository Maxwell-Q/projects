In general, each sample was represented as a vector of TFIDF and the K-means classifier put samples with similar TFIDFs into groups which means the samples within the same group has similar word distributions. The entire dataset was divided into 15 groups based on the rule of thumb. The purpose of grouping is to find which courses have similar course topics. After grouping was done, the top 20 words with the highest total TFIDFs calculated based on all group memebers were selected as the representative topics(key words) of each individual group of courses. These topics or key words were then be used as references for MIE1624 topic selection."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KvY3TW62Lutl","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["kmeans =
